In the Desert, by Stephen Crane

In the desert<br/>
I saw a creature, naked, bestial,<br/>
Who, squatting upon the ground,<br/>
Held his heart in his hands,<br/>
And ate of it.<br/>
I said, "Is it good, friend?"<br/>
"It is bitterâ€”bitter," he answered;<br/>

"But I like it<br/>
"Because it is bitter,<br/>
"And because it is my heart."<br/>
